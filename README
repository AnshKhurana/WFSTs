An additional command line argument has been added in lookup.sh, which takes the place of $1 and tells which part is calling lookup.
lookup.sh usage:
./lookup.sh <part_num> <arguments as per different parts>
EXAMPLES
3.1 ./lookup.sh 1 ABSOLUT
3.3 ./lookup.sh 3 Qprefix.fst PRES

If possible, please run the parts in order since there are some dependencies and re-using of files/symbol tables.

The intermediate files have not been deleted, this helps in better understanding/debugging.


The program for 3.4 deletes fstdir if it exists already.

Assumption that the folder name is given in the form folder and not folder/

Helper python files:
genFST.py : generates files for 3.1 fst
genFSTlet.py : generates files for 3.2 fst
generatePrefixFiles.py: 3.3 files
genSuffixFiles.py: 3.4 files
acceptor.py & acceptLet.py : For building acceptors for words and letter sequences respectively
genMatch.py : generates output for lookup-merge.sh
Print "Not found" if no pronunciation is found.
